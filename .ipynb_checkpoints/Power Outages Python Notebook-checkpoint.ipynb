    "Power outage energy consumption statistical analysis is an extensive data science project. It involves several stages of statistical analysis, from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to assessing missingness, hypothesis testing, framing a prediction problem (its baseline and final model), and a fairness analysis. This project aims to deduce the most influential characteristics of a major power outage, and how it can help energy companies lead to more efficient allocation of resources, reduced economic losses, and increased safety for individuals and infrastructure."
